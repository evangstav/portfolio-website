## Image Guidelines

1. **Hero Image**: Use a high-quality professional photo. Dark or moody images work best with the site's aesthetic.

2. **Video Thumbnails**: Can be screenshots from the video or custom images. 16:9 aspect ratio recommended.

3. **Biography Images**: Portrait orientation (4:5 ratio) works best. These appear alongside text sections.

4. **Gallery Images**: Any aspect ratio works. The masonry layout adapts to different sizes.

5. **Logos**: PNG with transparent background preferred. Will be displayed at various sizes.

## Format Recommendations

- Use `.webp` for best performance (Next.js will optimize automatically)
- JPG for photographs
- PNG for logos with transparency
- Minimum resolution: 2x the display size for retina screens
